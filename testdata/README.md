# Test data for usage data analysis

*WARNING* - The data in this directory is junk! It is based on an extract of Cornell usage data but all the bib_ids and dates have been randomized. 

The purpose of this test data is to provide modest size samples of data in the same formats as the real usage data for quick testing. The real data includes item_ids and transaction_ids but these are not use in our analysis and are set to zero in these test data sets.

The two sets of similar but different data allows tests that results are not sensitive to specifics of the sample.
